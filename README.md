Hi! I'm Onur Varol.

I am an Assistant Professor at the Sabanci University Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences and 
Principal Investigator at the [VIRAL Lab](http://varollab.com/). My research focuses on developing techniques to analyze online 
behaviors to improve individual well-being and address societal problems using online data.

I developed [Botometer](https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu) to detect social bots 🤖 on Twitter.
